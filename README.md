This is a Native Android App that uses Kotlin code within Android Studio. 

This App provides meal suggestions based on the time of day. This application uses the “if” statement to determine which meal is suggested to the user. 

Based on the time of day, whether it's Breakfast, Dinner, or even lunch time. 

If the app gives out error messages due to the incorrect input, then the app automatically crafts error messages that ensure that the user tries again to use the correct input. 

The App includes a text field where the user can input the time of day and thereafter the user’s output will be displayed as the favored/preferred meal. 

In terms of the utilization of GitHub, I opened an account that will assist with version control and the implementation of automated testing and building to ensure that the App is robust and maintainable. (The link to my GitHub is shown below) 

This report outlines the development of a Meal Suggestion App, a modern web application designed to solve the common problem of deciding what to eat. The app provides personalized meal recommendations based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and available ingredients. This document covers the application's core purpose, its architectural design and key considerations, and a detailed overview of the development workflow leveraging GitHub for version control and GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD). The project exemplifies modern software development practices, ensuring code quality, automated testing, and efficient deployment.
